# speed-read
a basic javascript app with little UI design that takes a user's entered prompt and time interval, and prints said phrase to the screen at said interval


# future development
i plan on adding the user phrase into a form with a submit/keydown, as well as with the interval, and when both of these are complete then the first interval will begin.
